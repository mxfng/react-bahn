## Dependencies

- git

Also recommended: asdf (to use .tool-versions)

## Quick Start

Boostrap a project repo with a `curl` command:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxfng/react-bahn/main/setup.sh | bash -s my-project-name
```

The setup script clones this repository, runs `git init`, updates the project name in `package.json` and `index.html`, and makes an initial git commit.

After setup completes, install the dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-project-name
bun install
bun dev
```

## Structure

The template follows a feature-first architecture with clear separation of concerns:
