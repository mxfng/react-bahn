## Dependencies

- git

Also recommended: asdf (to use .tool-versions)

## Quick Start

Boostrap a project repo with a `curl` command:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxfng/react-bahn/main/setup.sh | bash -s my-project-name
```

The setup script clones this repository, runs `git init`, updates the project name in `package.json` and `index.html`, and makes an initial git commit.

After setup completes, install the dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-project-name
bun install
bun dev
```

## Structure

The template follows a feature-first architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
react-bahn/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/             # Static assets
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/            # API client and service abstractions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/         # Project assets (images, fonts, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/     # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features/       # Feature-specific components and logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/        # Layout components (wrappers, containers)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/            # Utility functions and shared code
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ routes/         # Route or page components
â””â”€â”€ .husky/             # Git hooks
